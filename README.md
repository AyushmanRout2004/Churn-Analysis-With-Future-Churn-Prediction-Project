📌 Project Overview

🔍 Objective: Analyze customer churn patterns and predict future churn using historical customer data.

🧹 Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed data from multiple sources using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

🧠 Analysis Focus: Identified key trends, patterns, and factors affecting customer churn.

🚀 Predictive Insights: Built machine learning models to forecast customers likely to churn.

🛠️ Tools Used

Python for data processing, analysis, and model building

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

Scikit-learn for predictive modeling and evaluation

Power BI for building interactive dashboards

📊 Key Insights and Features ✅

✅ Churn Rate Over Time: Visualized daily/monthly customer churn trends

✅ Customer Segmentation: Identified high-risk churn segments

✅ Feature Importance: Highlighted factors contributing most to churn

✅ Predictive Model: Predicted future churn with accuracy metrics

✅ Interactive Dashboard: Dynamic visualizations of churn patterns and predictions

✅ Revenue Impact Analysis: Studied the effect of churn on company revenue

📂 Dataset Details

Dataset Size: 50,000+ customer records

Columns Include:

Customer ID, Subscription Type, Tenure, Usage Metrics

Payment Method, Plan Type, Customer Support Interactions

Churn Status (Yes/No)

Special Observations:

Monthly churn rate ~ 5-10%

High churn among low-engagement and high-support-requests customers

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out?

🔹 Real-time Churn Insights – Explore key drivers of churn

🔹 Data-Driven Predictions – Proactively identify customers likely to leave

🔹 Custom Recommendations – Suggest targeted retention strategies

🔹 Seamless Python-Power BI Integration – From analysis to dashboard

🌟 Project Highlights

📌 Total Customers Analyzed: 50,000+

📌 Monthly Churn Rate: ~5-10%

📌 Predictive Accuracy: 85%+ on test dataset

📌 Improvement: Identified high-risk customers to reduce churn
